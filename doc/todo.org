** avoiding them entirely with -fPIC helps
currently have a workaround: a recopy() syscall that we call very often, including just before starting main.

* TODO work out why ASM_SPEC is ignored by libgccjit and/or the path is incorrect
* TODO decide how to handle __libc_early_init
The standard ELF code calls it explicitly; we currently treat it as an ELF constructor.
* TODO I think there is an unnecessary .flush left in the setjmp code
* TODO work out why the perl/pex pipe trick doesn't work
